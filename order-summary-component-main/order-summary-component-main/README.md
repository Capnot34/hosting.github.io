## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Css Flex
- CSS variables
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media query

### What I learned

During this project I got to learn more about designing cards and paying attention to details so as to get almost the exact design as the one given.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  margin:5rem !important;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve more on the use of media query to adjust my designs although I had no issue with using it for the particular design because this was pretty straightforward.
